- **Caution**: If you have no idea about above best-submission item, please refer the Assignment PDF for detailed description.

Solo portion:
My code worked well without any modification.

Group portion:
Our code worked well without any modification.

Creative portion (optional):
We decided to leave our creativity for further use.

Other remarks:
We figuered out that original lab7.cc consists of 2 hosts(client and server), 2 router(one side connected host and other side connected to internet to send/recieve datagrams to/from the bouncer). tomahawk.postech.ac.kr serves as a bouncer in this lab7, tomahawk.postech.ac.kr might be running codes to simply forward datagrams from port to another port. Since this behavior is hidden we can say that tomahawk.postech.ac.kr is doing something like L2 switch for this lab.
